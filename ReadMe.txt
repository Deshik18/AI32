Instructions for Running the Multi-Step Forecasting Test Script

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required Python packages by running the following command:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Pre-trained Models:**
   - Place the pre-trained model files in the 'saved_models' directory.
   - Ensure that the models are compatible with your TensorFlow version.

3. **Test Data:**
   - Prepare the test data file in CSV format.
   - The file should include the necessary columns required for testing, and its path should be provided during script execution.

4. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the testing script (test_script.py) with the following command:
     ```
     python test_script.py
     ```
   - The script will prompt you to enter the city name, step size, and the name of the test data file.
   - Follow the prompts and provide the required information.

5. **Review Results:**
   - The script will display the calculated metrics (MSE and MAE) in the terminal.
   - The results will also be saved in a text file named '[city]_step_[step]_metrics.txt'.

6. **Troubleshooting:**
   - In case of any issues, ensure that the test data file is correctly formatted and contains the required columns.
   - Verify that the pre-trained models are in the correct directory and compatible with your TensorFlow version.
